# Testing

Always test your code, things never go right the first time, not even for experienced programmers. Errors are part of the progress and no sign of failure! Always seek to clearly understand the message behind an error and then find a solution to it. It is also recommended that you write little tests for functions, to assure they give the desired output given certain input.

To debug your code, it often helps to insert some temporary explicit print statements along the way, outputting the value of certain variables. This can help you spot if things are really progressing the way they should.

# If You're Stuck...

...use library references, 3rd party modules, google errors and AI!

Programmers never know all functions in their language by heart. Part of the art of programming is knowing where to look and how to read library references. Library references describe what functions, etc., exist in what modules, what parameters they take, and what values they return. Use these references! For Python, just start at http://www.python.org !

Chances are also high that someone has already done what you want, or at least solved one of your subproblems, and made a module for it which you can use! Here is a small list of modules that might be interesting for you:

- [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org). Provides a nice introduction into programming with Python and an introduction into Natural Language Processing.

- [PyNLPl](http://github.com/proycon/pynlpl). Library for Natural Language Processing, written by Maarten van Gompel. Contains a lot of modules for dealing with text, specific formats encountered in the field, and interfacing with other external NLP software. All of the things we did in chapter three are readily available in PyNLPl. 

- [Scikit-learn](http://www.scikit-learn.org): Easy-to-use and general-purpose machine learning in Python. Provides many implementations of machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes Classifiers, supervised and unsupervised cluster analysis and many more.

- [Networkx](http://networkx.github.com) (not yet for Python 3): NetworkX is a Python language software package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. Supports many output formats that can be imported by e.g. gephi.

- [gensim](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) (in development for Python 3 at https://github.com/samantp/gensimPy3): Topic modelling for humans. Good and easy to use library for many topic modelling algorithms, such as LSA and LDA.

- [Pattern](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern) (not yet for Python 3): general Natural Language Processing library with support for Dutch and English part of speech tagging.

- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org): fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

  -  a powerful N-dimensional array object
  -  sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
  -  tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
  -  useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

- [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org/): open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. Very good and fast library for all kinds of scientific computations, cluster analysis etc.

- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/): Python plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. 

- [lxml](http://www.lxml.de/): Extensive library for processing XML files in Python.

- [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/): Interested in full fledged web-development? Django is an amazing open-source framework for Python that allows you to make complex web applications.

Moreover, we would like to encourage you to always open your source code and share it with others. This principle is called *open source* and allows others to use and learn from your code. Especially in the sciences, such a transparency is vital for reproducibility and for building upon each other's work. The Python language itself is fully open-source, as is the Linux operating system, and tens of thousands of other software packages!
