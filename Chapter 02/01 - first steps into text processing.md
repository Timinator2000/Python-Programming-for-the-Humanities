# First steps into text processing

The previous chapter has hopefully whet your appetite. In this chapter we will focus on one of the most important tasks in Humanities research: text processing. One of the goals of text processing is to clean up your data as a pre-step to some kind of data analysis. Another common goal is to convert a given text collection to a different format. In this chapter we will provide you with the necessary tools to work with collections of texts, clean them and perform some rudimentary data analyses on them.
