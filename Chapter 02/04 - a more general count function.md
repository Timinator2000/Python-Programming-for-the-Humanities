Our function `count_in_list` is a concise and convenient piece of code allowing us to rapidly and without too much repitition count how often certain items occur in a given list. Now what if we would like to find out for all words in our text how often they occur. Then it would be still quite cumbersome to call our function for each unique word. We would like to have a function that takes as argument a particular list and counts for each unique item in that list how often it occurs. There are multiple ways of writing such a function. We will show you two ways of doing it.
